# Active Context

## Current Work
Implementing multi-tenancy architecture to support multiple organizations in the wine production management system.

### Recent Changes
1. Created organizations app with:
   - Organization and OrganizationUser models for tenant management
   - Organization selection views and middleware
   - Role-based access control (owner, admin, member)

2. Added tenant awareness to all models:
   - Created TenantModel base class in core app
   - Updated all models to inherit from TenantModel
   - Added organization field and validation
   - Models updated: Vineyard, Supplier, Harvest, Tank, Bottle, Box, etc.

3. Implemented tenant data isolation:
   - Added TenantMiddleware for request processing
   - Created TenantRouter for database operations
   - Added TenantViewMixin for view-level filtering
   - Created TenantFormMixin for form-level filtering

4. Fixed redirect loops between dashboard and organization selection by:
   - Centralizing organization context handling in TenantMiddleware
   - Adding session verification and transaction safety
   - Simplifying TenantViewMixin to avoid conflicts
   - Improving error handling and logging

### Next Steps
1. Update remaining templates to handle organization context
2. Add organization switching functionality in the UI
3. Implement data migration strategy for existing records
4. Add organization-specific settings and preferences
5. Create organization management views (invite users, manage roles)
6. Add audit logging for organization-related actions
7. Monitor the application logs for any unexpected behavior
8. Consider adding automated tests for organization context handling
9. Document the new organization context flow for other developers

## Design Patterns
- Using wine-themed colors (wine-600, wine-700) for primary actions
- Consistent spacing and typography using Tailwind's utility classes
- Modern UI components with hover states and transitions
- Responsive design that works well on all screen sizes
- Custom form styles with improved validation feedback
- Consistent table layouts with enhanced status indicators
- Unified empty state designs across all modules
- Interactive data visualization components

## Notes
- All major modules now use Tailwind CSS
- Design is consistent across all modules
- Form handling and file uploads have been enhanced
- Custom Tailwind configuration supports wine-specific theme
- Status indicators follow a consistent pattern across modules
- Interactive features optimized for both desktop and mobile use
