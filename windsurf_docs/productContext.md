# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
Vinco was created to address the complex needs of wine production management, providing a centralized system for tracking and managing the entire wine production process from vineyard to bottle.

## Problems It Solves
1. **Vineyard Management Complexity**
   - Tracks multiple vineyards and suppliers
   - Manages diverse grape varieties and locations
   - Records harvest histories and yields

2. **Production Process Tracking**
   - Monitors juice allocation and tank management
   - Tracks fermentation processes
   - Manages cellar operations

3. **Inventory and Packaging Control**
   - Manages bottling operations
   - Tracks finished product inventory
   - Controls packaging materials and processes

4. **Data Organization**
   - Centralizes all wine production data
   - Provides clear audit trails
   - Enables informed decision-making

## How It Should Work
1. **Vineyard Module**
   - Records vineyard details and characteristics
   - Tracks supplier relationships
   - Monitors harvest planning and execution

2. **Harvest Module**
   - Records grape harvests and yields
   - Manages juice allocation
   - Tracks tank usage and capacity

3. **Packaging Module**
   - Manages bottling operations
   - Controls inventory levels
   - Tracks packaging materials

4. **Cellar Module**
   - Monitors storage conditions
   - Tracks wine aging process
   - Manages tank assignments

The system should provide a seamless, intuitive interface for users to manage these processes while maintaining data accuracy and providing useful insights for decision-making.
