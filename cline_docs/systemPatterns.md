# System Patterns

## Architecture
1. Django MVT (Model-View-Template) Architecture
   - Models for data structure and business logic
   - Views for request handling and processing
   - Templates for presentation layer

## Key Technical Decisions
1. Database Design
   - Hierarchical structure (Company → Suppliers → Vineyards)
   - Relational database with foreign key relationships
   - Built-in data validation
   - Conditional field relationships (e.g., supplier only for supplied vineyards)

2. Authentication & Security
   - Django's built-in authentication system
   - Login required for sensitive operations
   - User tracking for all operations

3. Volume Management
   - Real-time tank volume tracking
   - Automated volume updates on allocation
   - Validation checks for capacity limits

4. Data Validation
   - Model-level validation for data integrity
   - Form-level validation for user input
   - Business logic validation for operations
   - Dynamic field validation based on form state

## Implementation Patterns
1. Models
   - Timestamped models (created_at, updated_at)
   - User association tracking
   - Descriptive string representations
   - Help text for field documentation
   - Property methods for derived data
   - Clear business logic encapsulation

2. Views
   - Class-based views for CRUD operations
   - Form handling with validation
   - Object-level permissions
   - Nested resource handling
   - Context enrichment for UI components
   - Separation of list and detail views

3. Forms
   - Model-based forms
   - Custom validation rules
   - Dynamic field visibility
   - Conditional field requirements
   - Formset support for related data
   - Enhanced error display
   - Responsive form layouts

4. URLs
   - RESTful-style routing
   - Semantic URL naming
   - Resource-based organization
   - Clear URL patterns for detail views

5. Templates
   - Base template inheritance
   - Dynamic form behavior with JavaScript
   - Responsive design patterns
   - Consistent styling across forms
   - Card-based layouts for data display
   - Grid systems for flexible layouts
   - Interactive data tables
   - Clear visual hierarchy
   - Mobile-first approach
   - Component-based organization
   - Event delegation for dynamic elements
   - Contextual action buttons
   - Enhanced data visualization
   - Consistent color schemes and typography

6. UI/UX Patterns
   - Card-based information display
   - Interactive row clicks for detail views
   - Clear section organization
   - Contextual highlighting
   - Responsive grid layouts
   - Mobile-optimized buttons and forms
   - Consistent spacing and alignment
   - Visual feedback on interactions
   - Clear action hierarchies
   - Intuitive navigation patterns
   - Error state handling
   - Loading state indicators
